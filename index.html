                <h3> Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h3> 
                <p>
                <li><strong>1914</strong> - Born in Cresco, Iowa </li><br>                    
                 <li><strong>1933</strong> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota,<br> thanks to a Depression era program known as the "National Youth <br> Administration"</li><br>   
                  <li><strong>1935</strong> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian <br>  Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed <br> them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."</li><br>   
                  <li><strong>1937</strong> - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service</li><br>   
                  <li><strong>1938</strong> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to<br> budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school<br> study under Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants.</li><br>   
                  <li><strong>1941</strong> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is <br>  rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, <br>  DDT to control malaria, disenfectants, and other applied science.</li>
                  <li><strong>1942</strong> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li><br>   
                 <li><strong>1944</strong> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his <br>  pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology <br>  program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains <br>  of disease resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major <br>  climate on Earth.</li><br>   
                 <li><strong>1945</strong> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields</li><br>   
                 <li><strong>1953</strong> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling <br>  American breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertalizer. It goes <br>  on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.</li><br>   
                 <li><strong>1962</strong> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the <br>  Indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a <br>  rapidly expanding population</li><br>   
                 <li><strong>1970</strong> - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li><br>   
                 <li><strong>1983</strong> - helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize <br>  and sorghum yields</li><br>   
                 <li><strong>1984</strong> - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University</li><br>   
                 <li><strong>2005</strong> - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." <br>  Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the<br>  demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not<br>  inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants<br>  and animals for a long time. Long before we called it science, people<br>  were selecting the best breeds."</li><br>   
                 <li><strong>2009</strong> - dies at the age of 95.</li><br>
